/**
 * THE CONTROLS FOR ROUND 13's GUARDS.
 *
 *   node scripts/_control-round13.mjs list
 *   node scripts/_control-round13.mjs verify
 *   node scripts/_control-round13.mjs apply <name>
 *   node test/run.mjs
 *   node scripts/_control-round13.mjs revert
 *
 * Same harness as rounds 10-12: CRLF handling, `verify`, an unknown-key hard
 * failure, and an `also` that may name a second FILE.
 *
 * ══ THE BYLINE DEFECT HAD A DIAGNOSIS STEP, AND IT HAS A CONTROL ════════════
 *
 * The reported symptom — a saved note showing a bare em dash — was consistent
 * with TWO opposite causes: a write path that lost the author, or a read path
 * that could not see it. `scripts/audit-internal-note-bylines.mjs` settled it
 * read-only: the stored note carries all four keys.
 *
 * So the controls come in two families. `echo-*` restore the CLIENT-side echo
 * that was the real cause; `stamp-*` break the WRITE, which was never broken,
 * and exist so the write-path guards are known to fire rather than assumed to.
 * A suite that only guarded the half that failed would be blind to the half
 * that did not — and the two halves are one keystroke apart in the same action.
 *
 * ══ ONE REDDENS NOTHING, AND ONE WAS PREDICTED TO AND DID NOT ═══════════════
 *
 * `dash-in-a-comment` writes both banned literals into a COMMENT and reddens
 * nothing, which is the measurement: the source guards read CODE, not prose.
 * That is the defect this suite has now shipped in six costumes, and
 * `readSource(...).code` is the answer to it.
 *
 * `menu-item-reordered` was written expecting the same result and DID redden.
 * `deepEqual` on an array is order-sensitive, so the attendee menu assertion had
 * been pinning a presentation order nobody had ever decided — a correct
 * reordering would have gone red with no rule to point at, which is face two.
 * The fix was to DECIDE the order rather than to loosen the test; it is stated
 * at the assertion now. Recorded here because a prediction that was wrong is
 * more useful than one that was right.
