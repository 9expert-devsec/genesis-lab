/**
 * The canvas's iframe: its document, its styles, and its theme.
 *
 * ── WHY A FRAME AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Tailwind's sm:/md:/lg: compile to VIEWPORT media queries, and a media query
 * asks the browser window rather than the box an element sits in. The device
 * toggle used to be an outer max-width, so it changed none of them: at 390px a
 * three-column grid still drew three columns, headings kept their desktop size,
 * and settings.visibility INVERTED — a mobile_only section vanished from
 * "มือถือ" while a desktop_only one appeared. A frame has its own viewport, so
 * the same queries resolve against the width the author chose.
 *
 * The published page is untouched by this: presets.js's class maps are the same
 * strings, rendered by the same SectionRenderer. Only the box they are measured
 * against changed.
 *
 * ── THE FRAME IS FIXED-HEIGHT AND SCROLLS ITSELF, DELIBERATELY ────────────
 * There is no ResizeObserver here and none is wanted. Sizing a frame to its
 * content is the one part of this work with an unbounded failure mode: the
 * height feeds back into the layout that produced it, and `advanced.customHtml`
 * lets an author put `100vh` inside the box whose height is being derived from
 * its contents. A frame pinned to its column cannot have that bug, because the
 * mechanism that causes it is never built.
 *
 * The cost is a second scrollbar. That is accepted — a real phone scrolls its
 * own viewport too, so the preview is more faithful for having one, not less.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS HOOK OWNS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything a fresh `about:blank` document lacks and the canvas needs:
 *   1. the document itself, as state, so the portal can render once it exists
 *   2. the app's stylesheets, cloned from the parent at RUNTIME
 *   3. the root class list, mirrored — which is fonts AND theme (see below)
 *   4. a margin reset, because a fresh document has the UA's 8px body margin
 *
 * It owns no React tree. CanvasPanel portals into `frameDoc.body`, which keeps
 * ONE React root in the parent — so `useEditor()`, `dispatch` and `resolvedData`
 * stay in scope and there is no message passing anywhere in this feature.
 */

/**
 * Clone the parent's stylesheet links into the frame.
 *
 * ── BY RUNTIME HREF, NEVER A BUILD PATH ───────────────────────────────────
 * The app ships one stylesheet, and its URL is not a constant: in development
 * Next stamps a cache-busting query onto it and restamps it on every CSS edit,
 * and a production build hashes the filename. Reading `link.href` off the
 * parent gets whichever is current without this file knowing that either scheme
 * exists.
 *
 * `link.href` is the ABSOLUTE resolved URL, which matters: the frame is
 * `about:blank`, and a relative href written into it would be resolved against
 * a base URL that is not worth reasoning about.
 *
 * Marked with an attribute so a re-sync can tell its own clones from anything
 * else in the frame's head, and remove the ones that no longer exist upstream —
 * a stale sheet left behind after an HMR restamp would keep applying the old
 * rules on top of the new ones.

 * FONTS. next/font emits its faces under generated family names and exposes

 * classes on the parent's root element. The Tailwind stacks name a human family
 * first and reach the real face through the property second — and the human
 * name is not a face anyone has installed. Without these classes the frame
 * silently loses both self-hosted families and falls back to a system sans,
 * which changes every Thai metric in the canvas while looking merely "a bit
 * off".
 *
 * THEME. next-themes writes its class onto the same element, so mirroring the
 * whole list carries dark mode for free. The admin sidebar has a live toggle,
 * so this cannot be a mount-time copy — see the observer in the hook.
 *
 * Assigning the whole string rather than diffing: it is one attribute write,
 * and the parent's root is the only source either way.

/**
 * ── WHY THE FRAME IS TRACKED IN STATE AND NOT IN A REF ────────────────────
 * This was `useRef` + `useEffect(…, [])`, and that pairing had a defect with a
 * very narrow trigger and a total effect.
 *
 * CanvasPanel does not always render the frame. A page with NO sections returns
 * the “หน้านี้ยังว่างอยู่” message instead, and no iframe with it. On such a page
 * the mount effect ran once, found `frameRef.current === null`, and — having no
 * dependencies — never ran again. The author then added their first section: the
 * iframe mounted, nothing was listening for it, `frameDoc` stayed null, and
 * `createPortal` was never reached. The canvas stayed BLANK for the rest of the
 * session, through the add, through every keystroke, through autosave — and came
 * back only on a reload, where the page now has a section on its first render.
 * That is the whole of the reported “nothing shows until I save and reopen”.
 *
 * A callback ref is what removes it: the element's ARRIVAL is the event, so the
 * effect keys off the element rather than off the mount. It costs one state
 * update on a render that was already happening, and it fixes the symmetric case
 * too — delete every section and add one again and the frame is re-attached
 * rather than lost.
 *
 * `setFrameEl` is a useState setter, so its identity is stable across renders
 * and React does not detach/reattach the ref on every render — the failure that
 * an inline arrow as a callback ref would have introduced.
 *
 * Nothing else moved. The load listener, both observers, the stylesheet clone
 * and the documentElement class mirror are the same code doing the same work;
 * only what wakes them changed.
