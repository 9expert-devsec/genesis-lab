// the moment this deploys, with no author having touched anything. A page
// nobody edits must not change. Turning the price OFF is a deliberate act, per
// card.
//
// The renderer must NOT read this as a plain truthiness check, and the reason
// is recorded next door in round 39's article work: `.lean()` does not apply
// Mongoose defaults and JSON serialisation drops `undefined` keys, so a
// document stored before this commit reads the key back ABSENT rather than
// `true`. `content.showPrice !== false` is what makes absent mean ON; see
// sections/course_card.jsx, which is the only reader.

/**
 * ── ROUND 57: THE PROMOTION FIELDS, AND WHY THEY ALL DEFAULT TO '' ────────
 * docs/promotion-page-coverage.md §B measured both live promotion pages using
 * this card as a PROMOTION PRICE PANEL rather than the pricing tier it was
 * built as. Seven of that survey's fourteen field gaps are on this one type: a
 * BEFORE price, a SAVING, FINE PRINT and a corner RIBBON.
 *
 * ── THE DEFAULT RULE HERE IS INVERTED FROM ROUND 50's ─────────────────────
 * Round 50's `showPrice` above defaults to TRUE and is read `!== false`,
 * because it can REMOVE something every stored card already shows — absent had
 * to mean ON or every published card would have lost its price.
 *
 * These four are the other kind. They ADD something no page has ever shown, so
 * absent must render NOTHING, and `''` is what does that: the renderer already
 * guards every optional surface with `.trim()`, so an absent key and an empty
 * string produce the same markup as a card that predates the field. Reading any
 * of these `!== ''` — or copying round 50's `!== false` shape — would put a
 * stray element on every card in production.

   * offer, not scheduling one.

   * Round 39's absent-key trap bites hardest on an array: `.lean()` applies no

   * card reads this back ABSENT. `.default([])` covers the parse; the render
   * must still read it as `Array.isArray(...) ? ... : []`, exactly as
   * `features` is read, and never as `content.details.length`.
   *
   * Both fields default to '' rather than being required, because a
   * half-filled row is an author mid-thought, not an error — the render decides
   * what to do with one, and it renders the half that is there.

 * ── ROUND 69: `icon_card` GAINS AN IMAGE SOURCE (§G step 4, §H) ──────────
 * docs/promotion-page-coverage.md §C read both live promotion pages' “สิ่งที่
 * ได้รับ” strip: four cards, each a 512×512 raster ILLUSTRATION above a label.
 * `icon` is a Lucide NAME, so an uploaded picture had no way in, and §C
 * measured and rejected the alternative (`image` inside `card_grid` renders at
 * width 1600 with `h-auto w-full`, turning the illustration into a full-cell
 * tile with a figcaption and no card surface).
 *
 * ── IT IS THE *ADDS* KIND OF FIELD, SO IT DEFAULTS OFF (§H) ──────────────
 * Round 50's `showPrice` above is the other kind — it can REMOVE something
 * every stored card already shows, so it defaults TRUE and is read
 * `!== false`. This one ADDS something no page has ever drawn, so absent must
 * render exactly what a card that predates the field renders. `''` is what
 * does that, and the renderer branches on `imageSrc.trim()`: empty or absent
 * FALLS THROUGH to the unchanged Lucide branch. Copying the `!== false` shape
 * here would put a broken <img> on every icon_card in production.
 *
 * The value is a URL, uploaded through the same `/api/admin/upload` endpoint
 * every other image surface in this editor uses. No `publicId` is stored
 * beside it — the same choice `promotionCover` makes, and the reason its
 * folder is a sibling of `page-builder/` rather than inside it.
