/**
 * THE THREE SITE-ROOT DOCUMENTS. One list, two consumers.
 *
 * ══ WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The same three filenames were written out twice — once as literal rewrite
 * rules in next.config.mjs, once as a hardcoded array in
 * scripts/verify-legacy-delivery.mjs. Two copies of a list that must agree, with
 * nothing forcing agreement, is the shape of defect this repo has already been
 * bitten by twice (ADMIN_PAGES vs NAV_GROUPS, and the two audit classifiers).
 * The failure here would be quiet in the worst direction: the verifier would go
 * green over a document the rewrite no longer serves, because it would be
 * checking a list the rewrite had stopped using.
 *
 * ══ REPLACE-ONLY. ADDING A ROOT DOCUMENT STAYS A CODE CHANGE. ═══════════════
 *
 * This list is NOT an admin-editable registry and must not become one. The
 * ruling is next.config.mjs's and it is restated here because this is where
 * someone would try to relax it:
 *
 *   These URLs sit at the SITE ROOT, where every application page also lives.
 *   A catch-all like `/:file(.*\.pdf)` reads as equivalent and is one bad regex
 *   away from swallowing /promotions, /schedule or the whole [...slug] route.
 *   Each filename is named literally. A FOURTH DOCUMENT MEANS A FOURTH ENTRY
 *   HERE, written deliberately, in a diff someone reads.
 *
 * So the admin surface being built on top of this can REPLACE the bytes behind
 * an existing entry. It cannot introduce a new one, and it cannot be given a
 * pathname by whoever is using it.
 *
 * ══ WHY .mjs AND WHY NO IMPORTS ═════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * next.config.mjs is loaded by Next's own loader, OUTSIDE the app's module
 * resolution — no `@/` alias, no bundler. It already reaches src/ exactly one
 * way, by relative path to a `.mjs` file:
 *
 *     import { LEGACY_BLOB_FILES } from './src/lib/legacyBlobFiles.mjs';
 *
 * This file follows that mechanism rather than inventing a second one, and
 * imports nothing itself so it stays loadable from the config, from a script,
 * and from a test alike.
