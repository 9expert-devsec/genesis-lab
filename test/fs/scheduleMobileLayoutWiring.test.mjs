   * subject — but the claim it was making is the one worth keeping, and it is

   * The old arrangement was "one local formatter, wrapped by a second local
   * formatter". It held the two layouts on this page in agreement and could not
   * see anything outside it — which is exactly how /search, the page-builder
   * section and lib/formatScheduleDate each grew their own copy, and how three
   * of the five ended up rendering a round on 8, 10 and 12 ต.ค. as `8-12`.
   *
   * The new arrangement is "one formatter, IMPORTED, called at two sites that
   * differ only in their options object". So the guard now checks:
   *   · the formatter is imported, not declared here;
   *   · neither of the two old local functions has grown back;
   *   · the table cell calls it with NO options (the column header carries the
   *     month and the year, so the cell must not repeat them);
   *   · the card row calls it with month + 'auto' year + a threaded currentYear;
