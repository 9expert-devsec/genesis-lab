/**
 * The course EDIT screen's shape: left column, sticky rail, one save.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE THREE CLAIMS AND NOT A SNAPSHOT ───────────────────────────────
 * The request was not "make it look like the article editor" — it was that the
 * publish control stop being something you scroll to find. So the assertions
 * are about reachability and placement, which is what can regress silently
 * while every field still renders somewhere on the page.
 *
 * REACHABILITY IS STRUCTURAL, NOT VISUAL. The header is not `position: sticky`;
 * it is a `flex-shrink-0` child of a `h-[100dvh] flex-col` root, so the PAGE
 * never scrolls and the columns do. That is the article editor's shape and it
 * is the reason the control cannot scroll away — a sticky header inside a
 * scrolling document still leaves on a short viewport. Asserting the root and
 * the header's non-scrolling class is therefore asserting the actual mechanism.
 *
 * The create page is NOT covered here beyond one control: it keeps the linear
 * layout this round, and proving it did NOT acquire a rail is the point.
